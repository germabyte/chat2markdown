# üìÑ JSON to Markdown Chat Converter

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

### üîç Introduction  
This tool is a desktop application that allows users to convert exported ChatGPT-style chat conversations (in JSON format) into cleanly formatted Markdown files.

### üéØ Purpose & Problem Statement  
OpenAI's ChatGPT conversations, when exported, are stored in nested JSON files that are difficult to read or repurpose. This program extracts the meaningful messages from those JSON files and outputs them in a simple, readable Markdown format suitable for archiving, sharing, or publishing.

### ‚úÖ Value Proposition  
- Quickly converts complex, nested JSON chat logs into readable Markdown documents.  
- Clean and user-friendly graphical interface ‚Äî no coding knowledge required.  
- Great for documenting conversations, note-taking, publishing Q&A, and archiving AI interactions.
